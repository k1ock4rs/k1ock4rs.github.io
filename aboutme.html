    <h1>About Ben</h1>
    <p>My name is Ben Klockars and I'm from Rhode Island. This is my second
        <br>year at URI and I've been working to graduate in three years with a
        <br> Secondary Education & Math double major, hopefully to become a high
        <br>school math teacher. I spend most of my time hanging out with my friends,
        <br> whether online through video games, or in person by a campfire, but I also
        <br>play intramural soccer and run for the club track team. I have a dog named
        <br>Loki and a cat named Potato back home.
