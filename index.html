    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Ben, and here you will find a brief 
        <br>introduction about me as well as my upcoming Javascript projects. The
        <br> links to each of those pages can be found by clicking on the provided 
        <br>buttons. I know this may not be all that impressive of a website just yet, 
        <br>but I hope that by the end of the semester, I'll have built this up to 
        <br>something I'm quite proud of.
    </p>
